    "# Using an OOP-Approach for string citations in GFCC Decisions\n",
    "\n",
    "Kilian Lüders & Bent Stohlmann\n",
    "\n",
    "Contact: kilian.lueders@hu-berlin.de\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Abstract\n",
    "In this short tutorial, we introduce our object-oriented approach to capture string citations of the German Federal Constitutional Court (GFCC). The references have a particular layout for which we have created a custom solution. Here we first show the basic application of our solution and then introduce a concrete case study to show the potentials.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem description\n",
    "### The reference notation\n",
    "The GFCC makes very extensive use of self-references. They are virtually ubiquituos to the the court's reasoning and can be considered the court's most used explicit reference. Therefore, self-references are important to an analysis of the courts argumentation. These self-references generally have the following notation:\n",
    "\n",
    "*BVerfGE 58, 300 [336]*\n",
    "\n",
    "'BVerfGE' is the name of the official collection of decisions. The first number indicates the volume (58), followed by the first page of the decision (300) and a precise reference to a page (336). The last reference is optional.\n",
    "These self-references often occur as chain citations, for example, in the following format:\n",
    "\n",
    "*BVerfGE 25, 112 [114]; 51, 193 [210 f.]; 52, 1 [14]*\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we are dealing with three self-references. These chains of citations, which we will call string citations going forward, are of particular importance for the GFCC. They link different references to earlier decisions together and thereby \"bundle\" them to support particular statements or arguments. This bundling contains valuable information transcending the information obtained by observing the citations separately. To understand this value one has to consider that while often using self-references in its decisions the GFCC almost never adresses the cited case in text. This stands in stark contrast to for example common law traditions whitin in which their can be lenghty discussions about the applicability of findings from the cited case to the new decision. In making use of string citations, the GFCC gives us a rare piece of information on structure within its approach to its own case law. Against the backdrop of such information being very scarce, the information about which decisions are referred to whithin the same string citation is of great value to the analysis of the GFCC's jurisprudence.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The task\n",
    "The court uses the layout described above for self-references very consistently. There is slight variation, but ultimately the rules of notation are quite predictable.\n",
    "Accordingly, capturing self-references is also feasible with rule-based approaches. There is also research that has done this successfully[¹²].\n",
    "\n",
    "However, these approaches were quite inaccurate insofar as they lost significant information, such as the exact references or belonging to chain references. The big challenge seemed to be less the extraction of information than the handling of the information.\n",
    "\n",
    "The approach presented here tries to offer a solution for this problem. The simple means of programming 101 are used to find a customized solution for the string citations of the BVerfGE.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following, we will present our approach. It is not particularly sophisticated from the technical point of view. Rather, it is intended to show that very helpful solutions can be created with simple means of prgramming. In this case, it is about the storage and processing of very unique data of self references.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The solution\n",
    "The solution technique used is essentially the implementation of an object-oriented approach. Thereby, dedicated classes are introduced for BVerfGE references and its strig citations. These include the essential attributes and methods to use the data for common problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "We assume a certain basic knowledge of object oriented programming. The examples should be comprehensible even without this knowledge, but we recommend to acquire the basic concept of object orientation.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "The core of our approach is the class *Verweis* (german for reference). It can be used to save self-references in the BVerfGE notation. This is possible because it has the necessary attributes:\n",

    "- *anfang:* First page of the decision referred to.\n",
    "- *ref:* Precise reference (optional)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following, we show an example of how individual reference instances of the class *Verweis* can be created. We generate references to the decision 'BVerfGE58,300'. This is the so-called Naßauskiesungsbeschluss a very well-known and beloved decision of the GFCC."
